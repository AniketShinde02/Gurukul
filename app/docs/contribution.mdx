# Contribution Guide

Help us build the most focused study platform for students.

### Coding Standards

We follow these principles strictly:
1. **Production-Ready Code**: No partial or "maybe works" snippets.
2. **Error Handling**: Explicitly catch and surface every potential failure.
3. **Strict Typing**: Enforce explicit type checks and validation.
4. **Performance**: Minimize CPU, memory, and network overhead.

### Branching Model

- `main`: Production stable code.
- `v2.x`: Feature development and staging.
- `fix/feature`: Short-lived branches for specific tasks.

### Commit Rules

Use descriptive commit messages with conventional prefixes:
- `feat:` for new features.
- `fix:` for bug fixes.
- `docs:` for documentation updates.
- `refactor:` for code restructuring.

### Adding New Documentation

1. Create a `.mdx` file in the appropriate `app/docs/` subfolder.
2. Update the `_meta.json` in that folder to include the new page.
3. Verify the link and SCSS/Styling in development.
