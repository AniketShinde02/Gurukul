### Reasons for Banning

- **Harassment**: Any form of targeted harassment or bullying.
- **Inappropriate Content**: Sharing explicit or non-educational content.
- **Botting/Spam**: Using automated tools or spamming the matchmaking queue.
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be someone else or representing an organization falsely.
