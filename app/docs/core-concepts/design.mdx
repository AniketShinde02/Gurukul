# Vedic Design Philosophy

The Gurukul aesthetic is a blend of ancient simplicity and modern sleekness. We call this **Stone & Saffron**.

### Visual Rules

1. **The Stone Background**: We use `stone-950` as our foundation. It's solid, deep, and reduces eye strain during long study sessions.
2. **The Saffron Accent**: Orange/Saffron (`orange-600`) is used for primary actions, signifying energy and focus.
3. **Glassmorphism**: We use subtle boarders and backdrop blurs to create depth without clutter.
4. **Vedic Patterns**: Subtle SVG patterns inspired by traditional architecture.

### Intentional Space

Our UI is designed to be "quiet". We avoid loud notifications, flashing banners, and "fake" engagement loops. If something is on the screen, it should help the student study.
