# Safety & Verification

Safety is not an after-thought at Gurukul; it is part of our infrastructure.

## The Verification Gate

Every new user must pass through a **Verification Gate** before they can access matchmaking.

1. **Age Check**: Users are asked for their birthdate.
2. **Access Levels**:
   - **13+**: Can join Sanghas and public rooms.
   - **18+**: Can use Video Matchmaking.
3. **Legal Consent**: Users must agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

## Reporting System

We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment.
- **Instant Report**: Available in any chat session.
- **Evidence Collection**: Reports capture the session context for moderators.
- **Automatic Banning**: Users with multiple confirmed reports are flagged for automatic banning.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Inappropriate behavior results in a platform-wide ban. There are no warnings for serious violations.
